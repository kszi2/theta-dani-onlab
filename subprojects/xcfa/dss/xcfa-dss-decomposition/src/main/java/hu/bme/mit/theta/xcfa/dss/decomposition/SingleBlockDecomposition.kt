 * block `SB1`. Its entry is the procedure's initial location; its exit is the last location without
 * outgoing edges found by a breadth-first traversal from the entry (CPAchecker's choice, kept
 * as-is). The block has no predecessors or successors, so it is the root and its exit is never used
 * for a postcondition.
