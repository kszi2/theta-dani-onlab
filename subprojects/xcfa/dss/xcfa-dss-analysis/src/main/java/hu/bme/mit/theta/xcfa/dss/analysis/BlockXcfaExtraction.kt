/**
 * Extracts [block] into a standalone, checkable [XCFA] that contains only the block's own locations
 * and edges. This is the Theta counterpart of what CPAchecker's `BlockCPA` does inside one shared
 * CFA: restricting the analysis to the block's edges, starting it at the block entry, and making
 * the violation-condition location a target when violation conditions are attached.
 * - [precondition] (CPAchecker: the start state of a block analysis) becomes a synthetic
 *   `assume(precondition)` edge in front of the block entry. `null` means the most general entry
 *   state (top), which starts the analysis without any constraint.
 * - [violationCondition] (CPAchecker: the violation conditions attached to the `BlockState`, which
 *   make the violation-condition location a target) becomes an edge from [exitLocation] into an
 *   error location that havocs the auxiliary existential variables of the condition (see
 *   [DssAuxVars]) and then assumes it. Reaching the error location through that edge is exactly
 *   "reaching the block end in a state that satisfies the violation condition".
 * - [keepSpecificationTargets] decides whether the block's own error locations stay error
 *   locations. CPAchecker always checks the specification; Theta's checkers stop at the first
 *   counterexample, so the block analysis turns them off when it only wants the postcondition of a
 *   block whose targets are already known to be reachable (see `PredicateBlockBehavior`).
 *
 * The block entry and the block exit get separate clones when they are the same location (a loop
 * body that starts and ends at the loop head). This mirrors CPAchecker's `BlockStateType.INITIAL`
 * vs. `FINAL`: the block end "cannot be reached directly before processing the first edge" -
 * without the split, the entry state would immediately count as a block-end state, and the body
 * could be iterated arbitrarily often inside a single block analysis.
 *
 * Every [XcfaLocation]/[XcfaEdge] is cloned rather than reused: a location's
 * `incomingEdges`/`outgoingEdges` are mutable sets that still contain every edge of the whole
 * source procedure, so reusing them would not isolate the block. [sourceProcedure] supplies `vars`
 * (unfiltered), and [globalVars] the global variables of the extracted program (DSS passes the
 * program's real globals only for the root block, whose entry is the real program entry).
