 * or a future "least-used" strategy's per-factory counts) own that state themselves, keyed by
 * **list index**, not by the [CheckerFactory] value - a `(XCFA) -> XcfaChecker` lambda has no
 * structural `equals`/`hashCode`, only referential identity, so indexing by value is a landmine a
 * future strategy could otherwise walk into.
 *
 * A single strategy instance is meant to be shared across an entire DSS run (see
 * [DssCheckerRoster]'s own doc for why) - implementations should not assume they're only ever

 * The default [DssCheckerSelectionStrategy]: cycles through [checkers] in order, so - across
 * however many times [select] gets called in total - every checker in the list gets used the same
 * number of times, or as close to it as an uneven total allows (counts differ by at most one).
 *
 * Deliberately a `class`, not a stateless `object` singleton the way this codebase's other built-in
 * strategies are (e.g. `LoopCheckerSearchStrategy`'s `GDFS`/`NDFS`/`FULL`): round-robin needs its
 * own cursor to advance, and a process-wide singleton would leak that cursor's position across
 * unrelated DSS runs (and tests) sharing the same JVM. Construct a fresh instance per run instead -
 * exactly what [DssCheckerRoster]'s own default parameter already does.
 *
 * Thread-safe: DSS's concurrent executor calls [select] from every block's own thread, potentially
 * at the same instant. [AtomicInteger.getAndIncrement] is wait-free and linearizable, so every call
 * gets a distinct, gap-free counter value regardless of interleaving - the round-robin balance
 * guarantee above holds *exactly*, not just approximately, no matter how calls actually race in
 * practice.

/**
 * A list of interchangeable [CheckerFactory]s DSS can run a block's analysis with, plus the
 * (pluggable) policy for which one to hand out on any given call to [next].
 * [PredicateBlockBehavior] calls [next] fresh on every recheck - not once per block - so
 * "interchangeable" matters: [next]'s caller always uses whatever it returns as a complete, correct
 * analysis on its own, with no expectation that consecutive calls return the same checker or that
 * any one checker's own state carries over from a previous call. [checkers] should therefore be
 * several instances/configurations of an analysis validated to converge the same way
 * `PredicateBlockBehavior`'s own soundness argument already assumes (see its class doc) - e.g. the
 * same CEGAR config built fresh each time, or configs that differ only in ways that don't change
 * what a sound, exact predicate-abstraction check would find reachable (a different solver, say).
 * Mixing genuinely different analysis *strategies* in one roster - ones that could soundly compute
 * incomparable over-approximations for the same input - is an unproven extension this class's own
 * contract doesn't cover: `recheck()`'s dedup check is structural-equality-based, not
 * semantic-entailment-based, so two disagreeing-but-both-sound checkers could in principle keep
 * "changing their mind" forever on a cyclic block and starve quiescence detection. Not a concern
 * for a roster of equivalent configurations, which is what this was built and tested for.
 *
 * **Must be constructed exactly once per DSS run, and that one instance shared by every block** -
 * not rebuilt inside a `behaviorFor = { block -> ... }` lambda, which runs once per block. Building
 * it per-block would silently give each block its own independent [strategy] instance (its own
 * round-robin cursor starting fresh at zero), breaking "balanced across the whole run" while still
 * looking correct in any single-checker test, since a list of one is trivially "balanced"
 * regardless.
