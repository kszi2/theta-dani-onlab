/**
 * A worker responsible for one [Block]. Delegates the actual analysis reaction to a
 * [DssBlockBehavior] (a stub for now - see [EchoBlockAnalysis]) and owns exactly the routing and
 * termination logic confirmed from CPAchecker's `DssAnalysisWorker.broadcast` (plan §2):
 * - `POST_CONDITION` goes to the observer and to [Block.successorIds] only - forward along the
 *   block graph.
 * - `VIOLATION_CONDITION`: if this block has no predecessors (it is the root), that is an
 *   immediate, local short-circuit - broadcast `RESULT(UNSAFE)` to everyone, no need to wait for
 *   [DssThreadMonitor] to notice anything. This worker does *not* shut down at that point, though:
 *   it still needs to receive its own broadcast `RESULT` back through the normal loop and answer it
 *   (see below), like every other worker does. Otherwise `VIOLATION_CONDITION` goes to the observer
 *   and to [Block.predecessorIds] only - backward along the block graph.
 * - `EXCEPTION`/`RESULT` received: this worker shuts down and answers with its own `STATISTIC`.
 * - `EXCEPTION`/`RESULT`/`STATISTIC` about to be *sent* (whether self-triggered above or in answer
 *   to one just received): goes to everyone.
 *
 * On startup, broadcasts [DssBlockBehavior.initialMessages] before entering the normal receive
 * loop - every block runs its own initial analysis, not just the root (matches CPAchecker: a block
 * with no incoming information yet still explores from its own most-general entry state).
