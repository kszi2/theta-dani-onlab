 * that has just dequeued its last message but hasn't finished reacting to it yet must not be
 * mistaken for idle.
 *
 * A [processMessage]/[broadcast] failure broadcasts a [DssExceptionMessage] and ends this actor's
 * loop, rather than letting the exception kill the thread silently - not a concern with the stub
 * workers this was first validated against (plan step 4), but real analysis (build-order step 5+)
 * can genuinely fail (solver issues, unexpected states), and a silently-dead thread would otherwise
 * hang the rest of the network forever waiting on messages that will never come. Goes through
 * [DssConnection.broadcaster] directly rather than this actor's own [broadcast] override, since
 * that override may have its own constraints (e.g. [DssObserverActor] asserts it never produces a
 * response at all) that a failure path should not be tripped up by.
