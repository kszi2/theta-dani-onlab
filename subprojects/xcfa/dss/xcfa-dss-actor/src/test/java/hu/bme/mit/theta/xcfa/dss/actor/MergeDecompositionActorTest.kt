/**
 * Closes a gap `doc/DSS.md` has flagged since build-order step 8: `MergeBlockDecomposition` is
 * exercised by its own standalone `BlockGraph -> BlockGraph` test suite
 * (`BlockGraphMergingTest`/`MergeBlockDecompositionTest`) and, end to end but only against two
 * trivial if/else fixtures, via `XcfaCliDssTest` - nothing in `xcfa-dss-actor`'s own test suite has
 * ever run a *merged* block graph through real [PredicateBlockBehavior] directly. This matters
 * specifically because merging changes what a block's own
 * `predecessorIds`/`successorIds`/`violationConditionLocation` look like (a horizontally-merged
 * block covers what used to be several independent blocks' worth of locations/edges under one id;
 * see `BlockGraphMerging.kt`'s own doc comment on why a merged block's `violationConditionLocation`
 * defaults back to its own `finalLocation`) - real per-block CEGAR and the
 * precondition-accumulation logic in [PredicateBlockBehavior] have never been driven against that
 * shape before.

   * loop (which, checked directly, has no redundant block-graph structure at all to merge away:
   * every boundary there reflects genuine branching, so `MergeBlockDecomposition` correctly leaves
   * it completely unchanged regardless of target count - confirmed empirically, not assumed, while
   * building this fixture), `bodyA`/`bodyB` share the exact `(predecessorIds, successorIds,
   * finalLocation)` triple `horizontalMergePass` groups on, so real merging happens *inside* the
   * cyclic part of the graph. `flag`'s value never affects `x`/`y` (both arms are semantically
   * identical), so the SAFE/UNSAFE verdict is governed purely by [incrementY], exactly as in the
   * unmerged version - this fixture is a strict superset of complexity, not a different program.
   *
   * This is the single most complex combination this port's test suite exercises anywhere: a
   * *merged* block graph that also contains a *cycle*, driven by real per-block CEGAR through the
   * actor runtime. Neither `BlockGraphMergingTest` (which never runs real analysis) nor
